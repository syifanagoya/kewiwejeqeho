She is the youngest of three children and was raised primarily by her mother, who worked as a social worker. She attended Wilbury Primary School and Fearnhill School in Letchworth. She participated in all of her school's school plays and theater opportunities, as she did not have money to afford acting lessons. Soon after starting college, she decided to drop out to instead join a performing arts institution in London. She has said that she officially decided to become an actress around her 19th birthday and started emailing agencies to find representation. One of the agencies offered her a place in a workshop.
