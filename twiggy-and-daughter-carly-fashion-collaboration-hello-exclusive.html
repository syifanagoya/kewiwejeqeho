As they prepared to celebrate Mother’s Day, the iconic model and her 39-year-old daughter told <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!</a> in an exclusive interview and photoshoot about how they designed a range of pieces inspired by their family holidays in the Mediterranean for high street giant M&S, for whom Twiggy has been designing for since 2012. "Being invited to design the latest collection with her was a dream come true," said Carly, who created the collection's paisley and shooting star prints. "I’ve always wanted to work with Mum."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d141ce3ba38-twiggy-interview-hello-z.jpg><p id=ekfWUwPbuwHr data-wc=5><strong>Twiggy and her daughter Carly</strong></p><p id=eK18Ef1k1pqD data-wc=149>"Carly and I have always been very close," said Twiggy, 68. "We’re very lucky we get on so well; not every mum and daughter experiences the type of relationship we have, but our love for one another just grows stronger." Carly – Twiggy’s daughter from her first marriage, to American actor Michael Witney – paid tribute to her mum, who has been a leading light of the fashion industry for over five decades. "Mum has a heart of gold," she told the magazine. "I tell her everything; she’s so patient and generous in spirit and has always been there for me. "When I was growing up, Mum had an extraordinary life and had to travel a lot, but she took me everywhere with her. Now I’m a mother too, I’m taking my lead from her; I want to be with my little girl Joni every day of her life."</p><p id=eh_lrB7BurMv data-wc=1><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Twiggy talks beauty, fragrance and fashion with HELLO!</a></p><p id=e8JBd2FMQx8L data-wc=121>Twiggy – who also has a young grandson Solomon by her stepson Jason - told HELLO! that she adores being a grandmother. "When I first had Carly, I loved her so much that it was terrifying," she said. "What I could never have imagined is that I would love another child as much as I love her. But then Joni came along and what I feel for her is complete unadulterated love. "She’s brought a whole new dimension into my life," she says of the two-year tot. "When I’m not working, I jump into the car and drive over to spend the day with her and Carly. My husband Leigh [Lawson] jokes that he’s gained a granddaughter and lost a wife."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/af4b2f816057-twiggy-carly-z.jpg><p id=ey1PxBmg526q data-wc=7><strong>Twiggy and Carly have a close relationship</strong></p><p id=ebBwWq9HhMVQ data-wc=121>And little Joni is following in the footsteps of her fashionable family too. Carly revealed that the little girl always tries on her heels whenever the opportunity arises. "Her first word was 'shoes'," she smiled. Joni even looks like her famous grandmother - who she calls 'Mimi' - with her turquiose eyes and fair hair. Since her arrival in May 2015, the little girl has been the centre of Twiggy's universe. "When I first had Carly, I loved her so much that it was terrifying," Twiggy said. "What I could never have imagined is that I would love another child as much as I love her. But then Joni came along and what I feel for her is complete unadulterated love."</p><p id=et08fQgDOdyS data-wc=1><strong>READ:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Sally Wood opens up about having more children with Ronnie</a></p><p id=ePqUu0GAJmx1 data-wc=80>"She [Joni] also loves wearing ballerina tutus and clothes in purple and pink. I was very different when I was little. I refused to wear dresses and insisted on dressing up as Popeye and Doc from Snow White." Carly continued: "Mum's brilliant at making clothes. She made all my outfits, including my red, white and blue sailor suits. Now she makes clothes for Joni, such as a pale blue and white knitted sailor suit and red, white and blue mittens."</p><p id=eEQLJxguPrZX data-wc=14><strong>Like this story? <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcWdyaWNrf3OFj2irsKGXnMZurc2dZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZpqaqpyueqet0qGgqKZdmLytuMCbpquZpJ68r3nHnqOlp12axaS41Kygr51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
