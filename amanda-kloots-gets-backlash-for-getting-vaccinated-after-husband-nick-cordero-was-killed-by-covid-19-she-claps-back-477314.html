However, the new The Talk co-host got some serious backlash on social media after being accused of skipping the line to get it!</p><p>As you might know, Broadway actor Nick Cordero was only 41 years old when he died after testing positive for COVID-19 and his widow has been really vocal about how dangerous the virus really is.</p><p>With that being said, it makes perfect sense that she did not waste any time when it comes to getting the vaccine as soon as she was able to.</p><p>On Friday, Amanda was excited to reveal that she’d gotten vaccinated via a drive-thru distribution.</p><p>She apparently went with her and Nick’s 20 month old son and two friends as well!</p><p>She posted a picture of herself in her car while a healthcare worker gave her the first shot through the window and in the caption, she wrote: ‘I just got my COVID-19 vaccine! I went to a site and just waited in my car until all appointments were over in hopes they had extra vaccines. I was fully prepared to get turned away, but they said that they had enough tonight for everybody waiting. I cannot tell you just how emotional I was and I still am right now. I had Elvis beside me and also Live Your Life playing in the car.’</p><p>She went on to write: ‘THANK YOU to the National Guard that was here volunteering since 5:30 am today administering the Pfizer vaccine to all willing arms. I’ve been terrified since Nick has passed, as a single mom, of getting the virus and now I’m one step closer to safety.’</p><p>While many praised her for getting the vaccine, others wondered how she was eligible for one since she is only 38 and healthy.</p><p>That being said, they accused her of having ‘celebrity privilege.’</p><p>She was quick to clap back, however, pointing out that she drove almost an hour to get there and waited in the car until all appointments were over.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kloots argued that she did not see how all of that was celebrity privilege, especially since the unused vaccines would have expired anyway.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoq6vsMBmoqWnn6nAbrPErapmmpGYuK2t0qFkn6eiYrSmwNOipaBlppawpLXNmquenF2Ws7Wx0WafrquSlrulec2imqRlk6S%2FpbHRqGSwmaNiuKq4y56bZpqpYrCwwsidZGpxXai1pnnCpZipq12XrqS3jG1ucGthaXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
