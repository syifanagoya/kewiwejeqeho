The thinking behind those is often that they include an hour for lunch — so you’re still working eight hours, but the finish time is <b>nine hours after</b> your start time because of lunch.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-hours-is-9am-to-7pm></span>How many hours is 9AM to 7pm?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1 Expert Answer<p>Add to get a total of <b>10 hours</b>.

Under a typical 9/80 arrangement, employees work four 9-hour days, followed by an 8-hour workday that is split into two 4-hour periods.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-people-actually-work-9-5></span>Do people actually work 9 5?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So no, <b>there are very few people</b> who work 9–5 at a 9–5 job in the USA. Some factory jobs where the operation goes 24 hr/day will have two 12 hour shifts or 3 eight hour shifts a day. Those people will typically only work 8 hours. Lunch is on the clock.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-calculate-my-hours-and-work></span>How do I calculate my hours and work?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>First, determine <b>the total number of hours worked by multiplying the hours per week by the number of weeks in a year (52)</b>. Next, divide this number from the annual salary. For example, if an employee has a salary of $50,000 and works 40 hours per week, the hourly rate is $50,000/2,080 (40 x 52) = $24.04.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-calculate-work></span>How do I calculate work?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Work can be calculated with the equation: <b>Work = Force × Distance</b>. The SI unit for work is the joule (J), or Newton • meter (N • m). One joule equals the amount of work that is done when 1 N of force moves an object over a distance of 1 m.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-calculate-my-hours-per-week></span>How do I calculate my hours per week?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Add up the total number of hours you worked in the two highest earning quarters in the 12 months prior to your application. <b>Divide the number of total hours by 26</b> (the number of weeks in two quarters). The resulting number is the average number of hours you work per week.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-convert-hours-into-payroll-hours></span>How do you convert hours into payroll hours?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>All you need to do is <b>divide your minutes by 60</b>. For example, say your employee worked 20 hours and 15 minutes during the week. Divide your total minutes by 60 to get your decimal. For this pay period, your employee worked 20.25 hours.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-calculate-payroll></span>How do you calculate payroll?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>How is Payroll calculated in India?</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Net Salary = Gross Salary – Gross Deductions.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>here,</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + All types of Allowances + Reimbursements + Arrears + Bonus.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Gross Deductions = Professional Tax + Public Provident Fund + Income Tax + Insurance + Leave adjustments + Loan repayments (if any)</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-calculate-my-work-hours-per-month></span>How do I calculate my work hours per month?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To calculate the average working hours of 195 per month we take 52 weeks (total weeks in a year) and multiply it by 45 hours per week. This gives you a total of 2340 hours per year. The total figure is then divided by 12 months to get to 195 hours per month.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-add-work-hours></span>How do you add work hours?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Take your number of minutes and multiply by 60</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Take your number of minutes and multiply by 60.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Say you had a decimal of 0.75 hours.
