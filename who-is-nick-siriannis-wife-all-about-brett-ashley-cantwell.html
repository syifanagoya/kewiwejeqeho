Fuck you!”&nbsp;The young coach said the profanity stemmed from an obligation to stand up for his team. Sirianni said (per&nbsp;NBC Sports):</p><p>“Hey, I’m always going to stick up for our guys. You saw me, you may have seen me in the Jets game this preseason and they hit Jalen [Hurts] late out of bounds and I reacted very similar.”</p><p>Sirianni and the Eagles have impressed this season – they have the only 100% record in the NFL after six games.&nbsp;</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Nick married his wife, Brett Ashley Cantwell, in 2013, and they share three kids">Nick married his wife, Brett Ashley Cantwell, in 2013, and they share three kids</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Brett supported Eagles fans when they booed Nick">Brett supported Eagles fans when they booed Nick</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nick-married-his-wife-brett-ashley-cantwell-in-2013-and-they-share-three-kids></span>Nick married his wife, Brett Ashley Cantwell, in 2013, and they share three kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brett Ashley Cantwell was born on 26th August 1986 in Springfield, Missouri. She grew up alongside her older siblings, Justin and Courtney.&nbsp;</p><p>Ashley met Nick after she moved to Kansas City to begin her teaching career. At the time, Nick was the offensive quality control coach for the Kansas City Chiefs. Courtney reportedly persuaded Brett to go out with Nick, sparking a romance that still burns strong.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick and Brett wed on 22nd June 2013 in Kansas City. The couple welcomed their first son, Jacob, in 2015; Taylor, their daughter, arrived in 2017; Miles, the last born, was born in 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brett-supported-eagles-fans-when-they-booed-nick></span>Brett supported Eagles fans when they booed Nick<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During Nick’s first year, the Eagles endured an underwhelming start to the season. In the second preseason match, the Eagles lost 35-0 to the Patriots. Understandably, the pessimistic Eagles fans jeered and booed their new coach.&nbsp;</p><p>NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth said on&nbsp;Sunday Night Football&nbsp;that Brett sided with the Eagles fans rather than her husband. Collinsworth explained:</p><p>“And he [Nick] went home, and he was like ‘can you believe they were booing us – 28-0 and it’s preseason?’ His wife [Brett] was like, ‘what did you give them to cheer about?’ It didn’t take her long to fit right in.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynoJyjXai2s7XAp6Wiq12stqexjJqjpWWRl7y2wIybqZ6spGKutLTLnrBmm5Gjwbixy6Vm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
