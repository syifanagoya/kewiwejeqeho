Unfortunately, their first son —&nbsp;Nevada Alexander, born in 2002 —&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">succumbed to sudden&nbsp;infant death syndrome</a> at ten weeks old.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Two years after the tragedy, the duo welcomed twins, Xavier and Griffin, into their family. Both of them were conceived via In vitro fertilization (IVF).</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Musk and his then-wife followed the same procedure and gave birth to triplets —&nbsp;Kai, Saxon, and Damian — in 2006. After that, however, their relationship faltered, and the pair divorced in 2008.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Today, they share&nbsp;the joint custody of their kids. Though Musk doesn't talk&nbsp;much about his children, he admitted his love for them through an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">op-ed on Business Insider</a>&nbsp;in 2010.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After clarifying that cheating wasn't involved in his divorce, the business tycoon mentioned he spent all of his non-work waking hours with his boys. He even heralded them as the love of his life.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Elon Musk's Girlfriends after Divorce</h2><p>Right after his divorce from Wilson, Musk got into a romantic relationship with&nbsp;English actress&nbsp;Talulah Riley. Their tumultuous relationship saw them getting married twice.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Musk and Riley first tied the knot&nbsp;in 2010 and briefly parted in 2012. Then, they renewed their wedding vows in 2013, only to separate three years later&nbsp;in 2016.</p><p>Musk moved on from his broken marriage and had an on-and-off relationship with <a href=# rel=follow>Amber Heard</a>, starting in the summer of 2016. They dated for a year and parted ways in 2017.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The 50-year-old didn't have any children with his ex-partners. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Elon Musk’s Son with Girlfriend Grimes</h2><p>After Heard, Musk privately started dating his now-girlfriend, <a href=# rel=follow>Grimes</a>. The duo met on Twitter and bonded over their passion for artificial intelligence. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But they waited a while before announcing their relationship through a red carpet debut at the 2018's Met Gala, held on May 7, 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Things moved smoothly after the debut, and the Canadian singer started flaunting her baby bump on her socials in January 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Her pregnancy, however, wasn't as surprising as her son's name. She and musk let the internet into a frenzy after stating that they named their son, born on May 4, 2020, X Æ A-Xii Musk.</p><p>Thankfully, a day later, the mother-of-one took to Twitter to clarify the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">meaning behind her son's name</a>, pronounced as&nbsp;X Ash A-12.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She mentioned X stood for an unknown variable, while&nbsp;Æ was the eleven spelling of AI.&nbsp;A-12 as a whole referred to the CIA's Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance plane.&nbsp;</p><p>She added that A also represented her favorite song, 'Archangel,' and 12 stood for&nbsp;the Chinese zodiac sign of the rat.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On September 7, 2021, the 33-year-old told Vogue&nbsp;that their son <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">calls her by her first name</a>. She mentioned she didn't like to be called a mother and opined that her son could sense her distaste for the word.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2cpLtuudSsomavmZuybq%2FHoqOdqpWje6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
