Their family has been through tough times lately, although Savannah's brother has gotten engaged.</p><p class=Fg>Savannah Chrisley is a television star who is also known for appearing in a few films over the years. The actress has taken to Instagram recently, posting an adorable moment that she shared with her niece Chloe Chrisley on her Instagram story.</p><p class=Fg>Savannah uploaded a now-expired sweet message that Chloe left on her way to school, responding to the notes she prepared for the pupil. It is a difficult time for her family, and these moments are the silver lining of their dark cloud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c08449c2e3034b00ccf5f029ea157fb538e062460255704dbded6b36fb711778.png><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Screenshot from Savannah Chrisley's Instagram story from April 4. | Source: Instagram.com/savannahchrisley</p><p class=Fg>The pupil says she loves Savannah more on a napkin on her way out. The TV star took a picture of the sweet note to share with her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/savannahchrisley/>Instagram followers</a> and wrote, "When Chloe leaves a note in response to her lunch notes."</p><p class=Fg>The emojis in the text suggest that the little gesture of appreciation touched her. Savannah and her niece have been spending time together, as seen in her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpY4JMiNinx/?img_index=1">recent Instagram video</a>. The caption revealed more about Savannah's devotion to family. It <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpY4JMiNinx/>reads</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me."</p><p class=Fg>Savannah is often seen on social media with her younger brother Grayson Chrisley and her niece Chloe. This is no coincidence; she inherited <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2022/11/22/savannah-chrisley-has-custody-of-grayson-chloe-after-sentencing/>full legal custody</a> of the kids after her parents lost their legal battle.</p><p class=Fg>The "Royal Pains" actress's parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley got a combined sentence of 19 years. Savannah is now staring at a future that she projects to be painful and difficult. She considers custody of the children as the most challenging part of her parents' conviction.</p><p class=Fg>The couple landed in jail after being charged with tax evasion and found guilty in June 2022. Todd will serve out a 12-year sentence while Julie does seven. They are parents to Savannah, son Chase Chrisley, daughter Lindsie Chrisley and Chloe's father, Kyle Chrisley, who <a class="Xd a" href=#>lost custody of her</a> in 2016.</p><p class=Fg>Being the sole caregiver for two children can be challenging, but Savannah positively embraces the situation. She shared an <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqO7z85Jm3g/?img_index=1">Instagram video</a> about the mountainous task over a week ago. She said she chooses to laugh, smile, love, learn, be patient, be kind, and find hope in God.</p><p class=Fg>"Life can really SUCK sometimes… but these laughs and smiles have shown me that beauty can rise from the ashes. Nothing is forever…. Until we're all together again… it's 'The Three Musketeers' ❤️ #iloveyoumom #iloveyoudad," she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqO7z85Jm3g/?img_index=1">concluded</a> her caption.</p><p class=Fg>Savannah's parents know the challenges of raising two children, as they have brought up a few of their own. In light of this task ahead of his daughter, while locked up in prison, Todd Chrisley <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/savannah-chrisley-shares-parenting-advice-todd-chrisley-gave-her-from-prison-give-yourself-some-grace/>shared some advice</a> for his deflated daughter.</p><p class=Fg>After Savannah reached out to him with an email, Todd responded with thoughtful advice encouraging Savannah to give herself grace. He wrote that she should fall in love with the kind and compassionate person within her, adding that Savannah should lose her soul and gain the world.</p><p class=Fg>She visited her father the next day in prison, and before she could embark on her journey to see him, her father wished her safe travels. Savannah's brother Chase got engaged to <a class="Xd a" href=#>Emmy Medders</a> recently, but the timing was off as his parents got <a class="Xd a" href=#>incarcerated shortly after</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1na2xnZXq0rdWapaeZmGKwqb7IrKOesV2otaK%2BxKxkraelmLWqusZmpaislWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
