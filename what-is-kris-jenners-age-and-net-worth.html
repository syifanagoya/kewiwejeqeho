The first one is easy: Kris Jenner is 68. She was born Kristen Mary Houghton on Nov. 5, 1955 in sunny San Diego, California. It was&nbsp;the 15th anniversary of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s historic election to a third term as president, the 350th anniversary of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Gunpowder Plot</a>, five years to the day before the birth of Tilda Swinton, and the very same day that beloved French artist Maurice Utrillo passed away in Dax due to complications from lung disease. Man, 68 years without Maurice Utrillo. Time really does fly.</p><h2 id=h-what-s-kris-jenner-s-net-worth-though data-injectable=false>What’s Kris Jenner’s net worth, though?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>As for her net worth, that’s a little less concrete. For our best estimate, we’ll have to rely on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, a website with an army of fastidious accountants keeping eyes on the values of the rich and famous. Per their research, Jenner is worth a stunning $170 million. For context, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sotheby’s</a> currently lists two paintings by Maurice Utrillo as up for auction, valued at between $25,000 and $70,000. Jenner could buy both of them if she wanted to.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>She came by her impressive fortune the long, hard, work-a-day way. After her 1991 marriage to Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner, she became her husband’s promoter, and later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">managed each of her daughters</a>, learning to spin fame into gold. It’s a life skill that she honed for the next 16 years, and in 2007, used to leverage toward the creation of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the reality show concept that she convinced Ryan Seacrest to invest in.</p><p data-characters=856 data-current-count=856 data-injectable=false>An explosive, compounding series of successes followed. Keeping Up With the Kardashians begat 15 spinoff shows, executive produced by Jenner, with the most recent, The Kardashians, debuting on Hulu in 2022. Endorsement deals for companies like Shutterfly poured in. Jenner wrote an autobiography and a cookbook, and helped to launch family business ventures like Kylie Cosmetics, KKW Beauty, and the Kendall+Kylie collection. At present, she is estimated to take in around $40 million a year, or about $39.9 million more than an astronaut in the United States. Let that be a lesson, future astronauts: Reach for the stars, sure, but also consider setting some time aside to raise a pile of famous children with a crippling fear of whales. You want to talk about net worth? No net is worth more than the one that keeps a whale away from you. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Just ask Khloe</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZuntrR5yZ6lp52iqHqis8RmmKecXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
