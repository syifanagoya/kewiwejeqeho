As an image of the monarch flashed up on screen, Dame Helen said:<strong> "Your Majesty, you were our nation's leading star.</strong>" The actress, 77, has portrayed the monarch on the silver screen and on the stage, winning an Oscar and Bafta for her depiction in 2006's biographical drama The Queen.</p><h3>Wrong winner announced</h3><p id=er5kCJyL2ECJ data-wc=85>Although the BBC decided to edit this part, CODA actor Troy Kotsur appeared on stage to present the award for Best Supporting Actress but <a class=hm-link href=#>mistakenly announced Carey Mulligan's name</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;it was confirmed Kerry Condon was the actual winner. Carey was nominated in the category for her role as Meghan Twohey in the film She Said while Kerry was nominated for her part as Siobhán Súilleabháin in The Banshees of Inisherin.
