During a segment of her podcast, Teddi Tea Pod With <a href=# title="Teddi Mellencamp Says She’s Lost Almost 50 Pounds And Is Only 15 Away From Her Pre-Baby Weight – Here’s Her Secret!">Teddi Mellencamp</a>, the 39-year-old reality star explained how she had discovered her contract’s expiration.</p><p>Mellencamp said on her podcast that she actually found out about being removed from&nbsp;Real Housewives from some of her fans before the network said anything. Teddi claims that she was exercising last Monday and her friends started texting her.</p><p>According to Teddi, her girlfriends – who aren’t on television shows – texted her and said they had read an article from the Daily Mail about how she had been fired. The reality star claims her first reaction was one of surprise and disbelief.</p><p>After reading the article in the Mail, posted near the start of the month, the reality star reached out to her agents and managers to ask if the rumors were true, which they turned out to be. Mellencamp went on to say that she was surprised her contract wasn’t getting renewed and The Daily Mail found out about it before she did.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFZvTJlnGpy/</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teddi</a> admitted, however, that she knew it was a long time coming, despite being relatively heartbroken about what had happened to her. According to the Real Housewives alum who was on the show for three seasons, she did a lot of great things that had been edited out.</p><p>The star said that should’ve been the “writing on the wall.” All of the things that make her seem likable, and like a real human being, were taken out of the season. As for how her family reacted, Mellencamp claims her son was more upset about it than she was.</p><p>Her 6-year-old child, Cruz, was furious. She claims he asked her what he was supposed to do next because he wanted to become famous.</p><p>Despite the fact she was removed from the series, Teddi has a great relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erika Girardi</a>, Kyle Richards, and Lisa Vinna. Thus far, it’s not clear who will be replacing Teddi.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekmrGltYymnKWklaOwornPZqqasaNir6a1zaBknpyZqbKlec6uq2anlmK%2Fpq3LZp%2BoraOaxKrCxKxksJmjYsGpsYywqaKsmaO0brvNZquhnV2srq24jG1ranFmZ3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
