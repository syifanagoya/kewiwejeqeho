This shouldn’t be a controversial statement, and yet – judging by the reaction to a make-up-free, Botox-free and hair-dye-free selfie the 67-year-old Eurythmics singer posted on Instagram recently – it clearly is. Comments ranged from the supportive to the downright rude, but I couldn’t understand the furore. Is the sight of a bare-faced and clearly confident older woman really that unusual?</p><p>More than her smile lines and (shock, horror) lack of lipstick, I was interested in her hair. A wise woman once told me that a great haircut is worth any number of new dresses – I was 21 at the time and more interested in the dresses, but the older I get, the more I agree with her. By 60, a good, nay great, hairstyle is all but essential because the pigment and texture of the hair have usually changed and the strands have become thinner.</p><p>Increasingly, I think Lennox’s grown-up crop is a timeless option – it’s like the cut that Twiggy and Mia Farrow debuted in the ’60s, but worn by a woman in her 60s. Inspiration for this look is rich and varied and includes Dionne Warwick, 81, Jamie Lee Curtis, 63, and Judi Dench, 87. Curtis and Dench both keep their crop a silvery grey and the result is low-maintenance, flattering and modern. It also lets you play with make-up, colourful clothes and big earrings without ever looking too done-up.</p><p>‘I love Judi’s razor-sharp pixie cut in particular,’ says celebrity hairstylist George Northwood. ‘If you’re opting for a shorter style like hers, just make sure to maintain it correctly so that it looks sophisticated. Shorter hair still needs a little bit of maintenance, but nothing too drastic. Also think about whether you want an asymmetrical crop with a longer fringe, which is a bit messier and more undone, or a super-short, sleek pixie crop.’</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Vidal Sassoon trims Mia Farrow’s crop, 1967; right, Twiggy's iconic cropped hair in 1966</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Either way, Northwood recommends using a texturising spray to add body and a good finishing cream to remove frizz or flyaways.
