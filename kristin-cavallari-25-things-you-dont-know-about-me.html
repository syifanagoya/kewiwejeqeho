Read on to learn more about the Very Cavallari star.</p><p>1. I wake up at 5 a.m. Monday through Friday to work out before my kids wake up.</p><p>2. I’m allergic to cow’s milk.</p><p>3. I have 30 chickens, four ducks, three dogs, one barn cat and two bearded dragons.</p><p>4. I have a fear of public speaking when it’s an intimate group setting. Cameras don’t bother me, but 15 people do!</p><p>5. Most people think I’m from Laguna Beach, Calif., but I’ve actually lived all over: born in Colorado, [moved to] Connecticut, back to Colorado, [then to] Barrington, Ill., before moving to Laguna my freshman year of high school.</p><p>6. I’m trying to make meditation part of my daily routine, but it’s hard to find the time!</p><p>7. I have a bottom retainer that I’ve had in permanently since the eighth grade.</p><p>8. I launched Uncommon James in my house two and a half years ago, and today we have a location in Nashville, a new store in Chicago and an extended pop-up shop at the Grove in Los Angeles.</p><p>9. My kids [Camden, 7, Jaxon, 5, and Saylor, 4, with husband <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a>] are the fit models for Little James. I value their opinions when I’m designing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kristin-Cavallari-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-02.jpg><p>10. I only went to one class in college before I booked a hosting job and dropped out. It was public speaking. 11. I can play “Ring Around the Rosie” on the piano.</p><p>12. I’m a little OCD — super-organized, and everything in my house has its spot. I can tell if even a picture frame has moved slightly.</p><p>13. My elbows are double-jointed.</p><p>14. I’ve never broken a bone, but I dislocated my left elbow when Saylor was only 8 weeks old. Jay had to help me put her up to my boob to feed her!</p><p>15. My first job was working at a Bikram yoga studio the summer before my sophomore year of high school. I put the sweaty, disgusting towels in the washing machine.</p><p>16. I’m the best air hockey player in my house.</p><p>17. I took voice lessons growing up and actually recorded a song in my early 20s that will never see the light of day!</p><p>18. Two of my toes have the tiniest bit of webbing.</p><p>19. I auditioned for <a href=#>Glee</a> and had to sing. Since I knew I wasn’t going to kill the audition that way, I tried to go the funny route, so I sang [the Christian hymn] “Jesus Loves Me.” Didn’t work.</p><p>20. I dislike my eyebrows. I have such brow envy.</p><p>21. I hate blue cheese.</p><p>22. I believe in reincarnation.</p><p>23. I cook dinner and we eat together as a family every night, with the random exception here and there. We go around and each say our favorite part of the day.</p><p>24. I love leftovers for breakfast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I pierced my own belly button when I was in eighth grade and still have the scar to prove it.</p><p>New episodes of Very Cavallari air on E!, Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYxrbGasmJ67qL%2BMsqauZZSku7V5yqemsGWRl7y2wIymnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
