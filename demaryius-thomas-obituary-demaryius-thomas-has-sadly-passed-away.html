The medical examiner claimed that Demaryius Thomas passed away due to complications from seizures. After retiring from the National Football League (NFL) less than half a year prior to his death on December 9, Thomas passed away at his home in Roswell, Georgia. He was 33 years old.</p><p>In July, after undergoing an examination of his brain, a team of medical professionals from Boston University determined that Thomas was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, generally known as C.T.E. C.T.E., or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is a form of brain degeneration that is brought on by sustained head trauma. The illness does not directly cause death, and it is only possible to diagnose it after a patient has already passed away. In 2019, Thomas was involved in a car accident that resulted in his head being lodged in the windshield.</p><p>In order to remove Thomas from the vehicle after the accident, hydraulic rescue equipment was required. The medical professionals stated that they had a hunch that Thomas’ seizure issue was brought on by the tragedy. Dr. Ann McKee, the neuropathologist who examined Thomas’s brain, came to the conclusion that it was extremely implausible that C.T.E. was the cause of Thomas’s seizures, and that Thomas most likely died of asphyxia as a result of one of his convulsions. She came to this conclusion after concluding that it was highly improbable that C.T.E. was the source of Thomas’s seizures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMSmmKuxmarAbsDHqKSaq12kr6rA1JqpsmWUmrqivtiirKxlpJ28rq3SZp%2Baq12orqW42GanmqujmrFurdaasGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
