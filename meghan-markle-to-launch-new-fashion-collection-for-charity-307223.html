The first-time mom is adding fashion mogul to her long list of credits.</p><p>However, don’t expect the <a href=#>Duchess of Sussex</a> to have any old fashion line. Nope, Prince Harry’s wife is set to launch a workwear capsule collection that will also benefit her royal patronage, Smart Works. The latter is a charity that helps women either enter the workforce for the first or return to the workforce after years away.</p><p>Markle announced her latest venture in the new edition of British Vogue, which she helped edit.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ebh7tlnVl/</p><p>“When you walk into a Smart Works space, you’re met with racks of clothing and an array of bags and shoes. Sometimes, however, it can be a potpourri of mismatched sizes and colours, not always the right stylistic choices or range of sizes. To help with this, I asked Marks & Spencer, John Lewis & Partners, Jigsaw and my friend, the designer Misha Nonoo, if they were willing to design a capsule collection of more classic options for a workwear wardrobe,” the former Suits star shared the digital issue of the magazine.</p><p>It is an exciting collaboration that will allow Markle to combine two of her biggest passions, philanthropy, and fashion. She also admitted there could be more brands willing to help with the workwear, as well as the charity.</p><p>“Taking the idea further, many of the brands agreed to use the one-for-one model: for each item purchased by a customer, one is donated to the charity. Not only does this allow us to be a part of each other’s story, it reminds us we are in it together. In fact, if it’s a cultural reference you’re after, forget Cinderella this is the story of Wonder Woman, ready to take on the world in her metaphorical and literal cape,” she stated.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0lk8DWpNkq/</p><p>Meghan Markle released more details involving her workwear line via her and Prince Harry’s official Instagram account. It is easy to see by her words that the fashion collection, as well as Smart works, are incredibly personal to the duchess.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Prince Harry’s wife was five months pregnant with baby Archie when she first began editing the September issue of British Vogue. The magazine hits newsstands, as well as launches digitally on Friday, August 2nd. Markle’s new fashion collection will launch later this year with more details to come.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrSprc1mpJqqm6GybsDOZqOarZ6YtW66xLBkn5mjnbawuoycpqWklZjBqrvNZp2oql2YtaK%2ByK2wZmtgbH9zf44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
