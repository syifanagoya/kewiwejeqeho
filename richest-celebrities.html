After graduating high school, Will attended Lakefield College School in Lakefield, Ontario, but he was asked to leave after one semester for being a troublemaker. He dropped out of Concordia University in Montreal and moved to New York in 1990 to attend the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. As a teenager, Arnett was encouraged by his mother to pursue an acting career. He auditioned for commercials around acting and developed a love for acting.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>He landed his first onscreen role in an independent movie by <a href=# title="Felicity Huffman Net Worth">Felicity Huffman</a> called "Erie".
