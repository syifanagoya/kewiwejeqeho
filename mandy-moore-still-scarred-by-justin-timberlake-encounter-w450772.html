Watch her tell the funny tale in the video above!</p><p>Corden, a self-proclaimed “boy band fanatic,” couldn’t help but press the <i>This Is Us</i> actress, 32, about her teenage years as a pop star who toured with both the Backstreet Boys and ‘NSync.</p><p>Moore — who burst onto the pop music scene in 1999 with the release of her first single, “Candy” — had a wonderful experience hitting the road with two of the biggest boy bands ever, but there is one memory from that time in her life that still haunts her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/109384_1591b_james-corden-mandy-moore-zoom-a9357bb9-bafd-4a66-8f39-a297a165bf99.jpg><p>“I’m a terrible dancer, but I had background dancers at the time because that’s what you did, and I remember distinctly one time walking backstage, and I didn’t really see much of the guys because I was the measly opening act. Nobody cared about me,” she told Corden, 38, of her gig with ‘NSync. “But Justin Timberlake was there and somehow there was a conversation about feet or foot size. They were comparing shoe [size]. And all the background dancers and the ‘NSync background dancers and my background dancers [were there], and I stroll up at 15, like, freaking out that Justin Timberlake is there.”</p><p>While she was initially thrilled to be hanging out backstage with JT and the boys, Moore explained that their interaction was not what she had hoped for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2626012_justin-timberlake-mandy-moore-zoom-36aa6de7-144a-4b13-9abc-b4c910d5d764.jpg><p>“He was like, ‘You have big feet for a girl,'” she recalled him saying. “I’m sure he doesn’t remember this at all but I was so impressionable, and I thought the world of him and he was on a pedestal. I mean, 16 years later it stuck with me, so it really scarred me emotionally.”</p><p>The “In My Pocket” singer said that she was a size 10, but added, “I’m 5-foot-10!”</p><p>“I [was] going through puberty at the time,” she continued. “Yeah, it was embarrassing.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Though Timberlake’s words have stuck with Moore for more than a decade, the <i>Walk to Remember</i> star said that getting over the Grammy winner’s comment about her feet was not the hardest part of her early years in the limelight.</p><p>“Dancing [was the hardest part],” she told Corden without hesitation. “I have no rhythm. I’m super awkward. I think the powers that be realized very early on, You know what, you should just have background dancers.”</p><p>Watch the video above.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammZ6Zxm65zqipnmWjqbatuIysmpqqopqxbq7YZqGuq6Seu27AyKaZnqqclrimecSnmqitnqmys3nWbWxpb2dnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
