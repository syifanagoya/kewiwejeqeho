The VH1 Big Morning Buzz host sat down with <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> for an exclusive interview and admitted now that newborn daughter <strong><a href=#>Brooklyn</a></strong> is here, he’s definitely getting “not as much rest,” but he’s having a blast experiencing life as a dad of two.</p><p>“The new baby, Brooklyn, she’s awesome. She’s a great sleeper and eater,” Lachey, 41, told<strong> Us </strong>of his little girl, whom he and his family welcomed into the world two months ago. “It’s fun now, she’s starting to smile, so we’re starting to see her personalty come in.”&nbsp;<img decoding=async width=467 height=449 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Nick Lachey" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The biggest difference in having two kids is that when you have the first one you can kind of tag team. You know, you give each other a break…when you have two it’s divide and conquer…so [now it’s] not as much rest but it’s fun to experience both — a little boy and a little girl,” he added. Lachey said dividing and conquering also allows for “a lot of one-on-one time with <strong>Camden</strong>” and “a lot of good dude time” while Vanessa is with baby Brooklyn.</p><p>Camden, for his part, was “skeptical” at first of becoming a big brother. “He’s definitely very concerned about her now,” <strong>Jessica Simpson</strong>’s ex-husband, who is a spokesperson for Twix, tells <strong>Us </strong>of his 2-year-old son. “When she cries he wants to let us know she’s crying…and that’s good. I like that the big brother instincts are kicking in because he’s going to have to protect her.”<img decoding=async width=467 height=351 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Nick Lachey video" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Watch the clip above to hear more from Lachey, including whether he and his wife plan on having more children or not!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5tiuaKvx56wZquRrsBur8Cmm56mXZ7AbsLEq7BmqKKkwaav06KtnmWfm3qjrcGyZJuqn6S4rcXNZq2inJWkenN8kG5ocGs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
