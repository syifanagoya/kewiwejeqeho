In the early 1900s death was all too common in the oil boom town of Fairfax on the Osage reservation. Osage people were dying at alarming rates. Local authorities were quick to attribute these deaths to “accident,” “suicide” or “poison whiskey.” But when the Smith home was blown up in Fairfax it became apparent to everyone that someone was murdering the Osage people.</p><p>The Osage were known as the richest people on earth. Their reservation sat on the largest oil field in U.S. history. The wealth of the Osage was legendary and everybody wanted a piece of the action. Osage tribal members became the target of every thief and con-man for miles. The Osage appealed to the FBI whose investigation uncovered a conspiracy that involved a whole family. Lizzie Q, an Osage woman, and her three daughters held between them 6 headrights. The first step in the conspiracy was to ensure that her daughter, Mollie, inherited all the family’s headrights. The first to die was Mollie’s younger sister, Anna Brown. Lizzie Q’s family wasn’t the only one that suffered the loss of land, money and loved ones. Every Osage was touched by what history remembers as the “Reign of Terror”.</p><h3>About the&nbsp;Filmmakers</h3><p>BIG Productions is a Native-owned, independent production company operating out of Edmond, Oklahoma.
