The dressing company launched its eccentric <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> collection on Tuesday, November 13, and it includes items that are perfect for even the most picky people on your gift list.</p><p>In addition to two ranch-themed ugly Christmas sweaters that are described the “perfect way to show your HVR spirit,” the 10-item collection also boasts an array of unique goods. For example, you can purchase a tree topper that’s really just a luminescent bottle of ranch dressing, or a massive inflatable container of the popular condiment that’s ideal for sticking on your front lawn so all your neighbors can see just how dedicated to dressing you really are. That $150 item, which has already sold out, comes complete with a blower and tethers and is more than six feet tall.</p><p>However, if you’re not ready to be quite so forward about your love of ranch, smaller items such as the HVR snow globe or the bottle and shaker ornament set might just do the trick.</p><p>What’s more? It appears the clever geniuses over at Hidden Valley have decided not to release the entire collection all at once. An item called “Magnum of Ranch,” which holds nearly two liters of the buttermilk-based dressing, is scheduled to go on sale on Monday, December 3. The limited-edition $25 gift lets the “ranch flavor flow” and comes in its own custom-designed box.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ranch lovers worldwide were psyched by the latest HVR holiday collection, which is a follow-up to the ranch keg the brand sold in 2017. “If I ever have kids and move to suburbia, you bet your a– this is how I’m decorating my yard for Christmas,” wrote one Twitter user of the inflatable bottle. Added another: “This is what I need.”</p><p>Tell Us: Will you be shopping the Hidden Valley Ranch holiday collection?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqGhlJmyr3nVmqOlnaliv6K6wqGqZqCfobalrdhmmqiknJqwtbXOp2SippOhwqWx0makmp%2Beqrpuu8VmqZqmk516rrvRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
